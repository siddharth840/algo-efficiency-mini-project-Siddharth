🔥 Project Overview

The goal of this mini-project is to implement multiple algorithms, analyze their performance, and visualize their execution time behaviour as the input size increases.

Algorithms that solve the same problem can differ dramatically in performance based on design choices such as recursion, iteration, and partitioning strategies.
This project helps understand those trade-offs through real experimental profiling.

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Algorithm	Type	Notes
Fibonacci (Naive Recursive)	Recursive	Exponential time
Fibonacci (Dynamic Programming)	Bottom-Up	Linear time
Merge Sort	Divide & Conquer	Guaranteed O(n log n)
Quick Sort	Divide & Conquer	Very fast, but worst case O(n²)
Insertion Sort	Comparison-Based	Efficient for nearly-sorted data
Bubble Sort	Comparison-Based	Slow for large datasets
Selection Sort	Comparison-Based	Consistent O(n²)
Binary Search	Searching	Requires sorted input
🧪 Performance Profiling

For each algorithm:

✔ Execution time measured using time.perf_counter()
✔ Repeated runs to reduce random variation
✔ Results plotted using matplotlib

Input Size Strategy
Class	Algorithms	Input Sizes
O(n log n)	Merge Sort, Quick Sort	100 → 10,000
O(n²)	Insertion, Bubble, Selection	100 → 2,000
Exponential	Fibonacci (Recursive)	5 → 30
O(log n)	Binary Search	100 → 10,000
O(n)	Fibonacci (DP)	1000 → 10,000

The plot clearly shows how algorithms diverge in efficiency as the input grows.

📈 Key Insights & Findings

🔹 Algorithms with O(n log n) complexity scale efficiently and remain practical for large inputs
🔹 O(n²) algorithms become significantly slower as input size increases
🔹 Binary Search time per query is extremely small due to logarithmic growth
🔹 Recursive Fibonacci grows exponentially and becomes infeasible beyond n ≈ 30
🔹 Dynamic Programming Fibonacci is highly efficient and can handle large n easily
